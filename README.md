# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2021 ðŸŽ„
Solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) 2021 written in python3. My objective this year is to [code golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) solutions that are somewhat fast.
Every solution reads input file as is in the AoC website. Every solution also prints solutions to both of the days problems and nothing else.
