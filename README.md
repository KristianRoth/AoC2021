# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2021 ðŸŽ„
Solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) 2021 written in python3. My objective this year is to [code golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) solutions that are somewhat fast.
Every solution reads input file as it is in the AoC website. Every solution also prints solutions to both of the days problems and nothing else.
